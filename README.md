# Dropshipping website

Full-stack website that is built using Firebase and front-end technologies.

The website is a dropshipping platform where users can browse products, add them to cart, and checkout.

Some pages are not made because this is a demo version that is made just to be able to interact with firebase features,authentication,cart,payments etc.

# Features

- Making an account via Sign In
- Logging into it via Log In
- User can add products to cart
- User can checkout products
- Payments
- Database

TECHNOLOGIES USED: TypeScript,JavaScript,CSS,HTML,TailwindCSS,Firebase.

404 page for invalid URL on the host.
Also there is form validation,but its not that advanced.
# Mentions

This website is a copy of another one and they look very similar.I didn't added things that were hard to implement.I focused more into the functionality of Firebase than UI.

Website used for inspiration: [`simpletics.com`](https://simpletics.com).
Simpletics website look far more advanced,but it wasnt that much when i started this project,so i was focusing to look like the old version of it.

# Notes

For testing payments, write fake email and write 42 repeatedly for the credit card information.
Website is responsive(can be used on phones and tablets),but there are some errors due to tailwind rules.
Files that are not pushed to GitHub are enviorment variables and node_module folder.
